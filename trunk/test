SVN TEST:

Things to do for Volcano stage:
Add additional enemy type with volcano prefix
Add additional constants for stage type
Revise platform.mm to select correct stage platforms
Revise actionLayer.mm to stitch the stages together
Revise enemyCache.mm to call on correct enemy type at correct stage
Add burning type to mushrooms and enemies
Add non-interacting sprites represent falling rocks
Add interacting object represent falling rocks that lands in path of mushroom (may hit enemy?)
Add volcano ash effect (maybe)


Optimization:
Revise actionLayer.mm to draw stages and dealloc when mushroom approaches transition point (bridge ?)
